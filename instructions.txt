When a user enters a movie title into the search box and clicks the search button, make an API call to search for movies using the user input. Then, display all the search results on the same page. When a user clicks on specific search result, send them to another route which displays more detailed information about the specific movie. You'll need to make another type of OMDB API call. Lastly, users can start a new search from any page. To sum up the two main routes:

Search/Home Page:

DONE Input box for user to enter movie title.
DONE When the user clicks the search button:
DONE Search OMDb API for movies with the input text in the title.
DONE Displays search results on the same page
DONE Each movie in the search results has a link to a 'show' page

Show page:

DONE Shows the results of a more detailed OMDb API search using the movie's ID.
DONE Displays all the details of the specific movie, including the poster image of the movie.

Bonus:

DONE A user can specify what type of data they are searching for: movie, series, or episode.
DONE A user can check a box "Get Rotten Tomatoes Data" which will also fetch data from Rotten Tomatoes(using the OMDB API)
